    <h2>USSDial Privacy Policy</h2>
USSDail is an app that serves as a repository for the USSD codes of every Network and Bank in Nigeria. While directly dialing USSD codes for various transactions through the app, your device's Network or Bank takes responsibility for every follow up pop-up screen. USSDail only initiates the dialing of all codes from our repository and lets your mobile device take over from there. As a result, every transaction in the form of payments going on through this app assures you 100% control and ownership of your information, which includes your Bank account details, PINs and Passwords.
USSDail does not need the internet to function and does not charge you a dime for any transaction. It is completely free to acquire and use.
